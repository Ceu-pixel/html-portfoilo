<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Mohit Bhardwaj, a 19-year-old aspiring web developer from India. I'm currently learning the fundamentals of web development with a focus on HTML. I enjoy exploring how websites are structured and built, and I'm dedicated to developing a strong foundation that will support my journey into front-end development.</p>

<p>As I continue to grow my skills, I'm working on small projects that help me understand the real-world application of HTML. My goal is to create clean, well-structured web pages and gradually expand my knowledge into CSS and JavaScript. I'm passionate about technology and excited to build a career in web development</p>.
